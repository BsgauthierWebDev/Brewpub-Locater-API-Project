# Brewpub-Locater-API-Project
https://bsgauthierwebdev.github.io/Brewpub-Locater-API-Project/
Displays a list of breweries and brewpubs in a user-designed area, pulled from the Open Brewery DB site. User can access websites (where applicable) for locations and organize the list by distance from a chosen start point.


For this project, I've mainly utilized Javascript for the functionality. I've used HTML to design the text layout for the page, and CSS to style, but all functions are housed within the JS. This includes functions to provide a list of options based on user input and then sort that list and reproduce new results, based on a user selection. Also included is a function to calculate the distance between a selected item and the remaining items on the list, providing the user with those results as an additional piece of data in each line item.
